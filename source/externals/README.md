# Borrowings

Thanks again to Vitaly Puzrin and all the contributors of https://github.com/fontello/svgpath for their awesome SVG path data parser.  
as well as to all the authors of https://github.com/icons8/svg-path-bounding-box
While it might have been better for us to rewrite these projects so they match better our internal format, they saved a lot of time.
